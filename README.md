## The Basics

### Who are you?

Hi, I'm Johannes. You can find everything you need to know about me here: [johannes.ist](https://johannes.ist)

### Where are you from?

I'm from Austria. (And full disclosure: my English is still a work in progress!)

### When did you start programming?

I started in 2003, but then took a 15-year break starting in 2006 because I was super busy with my agency back then. Later, I had to update an old project I’d almost forgotten about—and I’ve been tinkering with various things ever since. It’s way too much fun to do all this without an audience or collaborators!

### Why did you start streaming forbiddenPHP?

I was frustrated with "clean code" and all those so-called best practices. Then I discovered hyper-fast scripts without the bloat, and... here we are.

### Are you serious?

Well, if it makes you feel better, you can just treat it as sarcasm or satire.

## Tech & Philosophy

### What tools do you use?

* **OS:** macOS
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (most of the time)
* **Terminal:** The basic macOS Terminal.app
* **Quick Edits:** Very rarely nano or vim
* **Streaming:** [mimoLive](https://mimolive.com/?ref=JoPhi)
* **Hardware:** (Switcher, Camera, Mic, Capture/Playout-Devices coming soon)

### PHP in _____ (please insert current year)? Really?

It was never "the right time" to use PHP. So let’s just make it the year of PHP!

### What about maintainability and scaling?

Do you really need it? If you do, use PHP wisely and learn how to configure and maintain the host operating system. Sharding and distribution aren't the concern of PHP; that's the job of the underlying layers (and the filesystem)!

## Streaming & Contact & Misc

### When do you stream?

Please check the schedule on Twitch.

### Can I hire you?

To be honest, commercial projects are rarely fun—too many rules I don't care about. So, mostly no. But if it has nothing to do with programming? Let’s talk.

### What do you do for a living?

I’m a teacher for German as a foreign/secondary language (DaF/DaZ).

### Do you have a private life?

Yes, of course.
